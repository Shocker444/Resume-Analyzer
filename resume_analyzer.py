                    ## Step 1: Extract Contact Information
                    First, extract all contact information from the resume:
                    - Full Name
                    - Email Address
                    - Phone Number
                    - Location
                    - LinkedIn URL (if provided)
                    - Other social/portfolio links

                    ## Step 2: Quantitative Check
                    Perform a Boolean (true/false) check for each requirement based on the candidate's resume:

                    - For each skill listed in `must_have_requirements` and `good_to_have_requirements`, determine if the candidate possesses it. Return true or false for each.
                    - For each `core_responsibility`, determine if the candidate has demonstrated it in their past work. Return true or false.
                    - For each `additional_screening_criteria`, return a boolean value indicating whether the candidate meets the condition (e.g., full-time, onsite position, work authorization, etc.).

                    ## Step 3: Qualitative Assessment
                    Now, switch to a recruiter-style qualitative assessment. Use your **intuition like a human** â€” go beyond what's explicitly stated. Read between the lines, infer intent, and use contextual clues from the resume and the JD to judge fit. Reference the results from Step 1 as part of your reasoning.

                    Assess the following:

                    - **Inferred Skills**: What skills can you infer from the candidate's projects or roles?
                    - **Project Gravity**: Were the projects academic or real-world, high-impact, production-ready, etc.?
                    - **Ownership and Initiative**: Did the candidate lead the work? Show initiative? Or just follow directions?
                    - **Transferability to Role**: How well would their experience transfer to this particular role? Will they onboard quickly?
                    - **Bonus Experience & Extra Qualifications**: If the JD lists any bonus criteria (e.g., fintech, B2B SaaS), consider that a positive signal even if not part of Step 1.

                    ## Step 4: Final Recommendation
                    After both steps, make a final call. Output "Yes" or "No" and summarize your reasoning concisely.
